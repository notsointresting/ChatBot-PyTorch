# Understanding a Simple Chatbot Script
---

## Introduction
This Python script defines a basic chatbot that leverages a trained neural network model to generate responses based on user input. The chatbot utilizes predefined intents and responses stored in a JSON file to interact with users effectively.

## Key Concepts
1. **Neural Network Model**: The script loads a trained neural network model to predict the intent of user input based on patterns and responses defined in the intents data.
2. **Tokenization**: User input is tokenized to convert it into a format suitable for input to the neural network model.
3. **Response Generation**: Responses are selected based on the predicted intent with a confidence threshold to ensure accurate and relevant replies.

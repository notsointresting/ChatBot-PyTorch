# Text Data Preprocessing for Bag-of-Words Representation
---

## Introduction

The Python code  focuses on preprocessing text data for natural language processing tasks, specifically to create a bag-of-words representation of sentences. The code utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to tokenize sentences, stem words, and generate a numerical representation of text data.

## Key Concepts

1. **Tokenization**: The process of splitting a sentence into individual words or tokens.
2. **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form for consistency in word representations.
3. **Bag-of-Words**: A numerical representation of text data that represents the presence or absence of words in a predefined vocabulary.
